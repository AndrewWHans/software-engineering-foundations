# Software Project Management

## Concepts

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create either a unique product, service, or result whilst having a beginning and an end.<br>
The end will be reached when:
- the project's objectives have been achieved
- terminated due to objectives will/cannot be met
- terminated by customer's choice

**Boehm's W5HH Principles**:
1) Why is the system being developed?
2) What will be done and when will it be done?
3) Who is responsible for a function?
4) Where are they located at currently?
5) How will the job be done technically and managerially?
6) How much of each resource is needed?

**Iron Triangle**<br>
Projects have imposed constraints of scope, cost (resources), and time (schedule) <br>
Changing one constraint affects one or both of others, you are **not** able to fix all three at the same time. <br>
Karl Wieger, suggests there is **five** interrelated project dimensions:

1) scope 
2) schedule 
3) cost 
4) staff 
5) quality

### Project Life Cycle

A series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. Phases are time bounded with a start-end/control point.<br>
There is a *scope* for projects with accurate aim to the:<br>
project's objectives | deliverables | milestones<br>
technical requirements | limits & exclusions | customer reviews <br>
**typical scope of defnition for a small project is about one-two pages long**

### About Risks

There are many risks that come into project management. To defining the word "risk", there must be conditions that come in play. <br>
A good definition, by University of Texas at Dallas's powerpoint:<br>**"An uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or a negative effect on a project's objectives."**<br>
In way, we can take that having the risk exposure = the probability (unsatisfactory outcome) * the loss (unsatisfactory outcome).<br>This can be pronounced as **RE = P(UO) * L(UO)** as well
