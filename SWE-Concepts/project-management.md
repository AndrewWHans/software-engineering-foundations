# Software Project Management

## Concepts

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create either a unique product, service, or result whilst having a beginning and an end.<br>
The end will be reached when:
- the project's objectives have been achieved
- terminated due to objectives will/cannot be met
- terminated by customer's choice

**Boehm's W5HH Principles**:
1) Why is the system being developed?
2) What will be done and when will it be done?
3) Who is responsible for a function?
4) Where are they located at currently?
5) How will the job be done technically and managerially?
6) How much of each resource is needed?

**Iron Triangle**<br>
Projects have imposed constraints of scope, cost (resources), and time (schedule)

Changing one constraint affects one or both of others, you are **not** able to fix all three at the same time.<br>
Karl Wieger, suggests there is **five** interrelated project dimensions:
- scope
- schedule
- cost
- staff
- quality

**Project Life Cycle**<br>
A series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. Phases are time bounded with a start-end/control point.<br>
There is a *scope* for projects with accurate aim to the:<br>
project's objectives | deliverables | milestones<br>
technical requirements | limits & exclusions | customer reviews
**typical scope of defnition for a small project is about one-two pages long**
