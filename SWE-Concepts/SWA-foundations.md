# Software Architecture

Architecture serves as a blueprint defining a system's crucial elements: structure, behavior, and interactions. <br>
A view of architecture is a 'shared understanding that expert developers have of the system design.' <br>
The wish to get decisions **right** early on. <br>

## Building blocks/key components include:

- Software components:
    feature the data that can be plugged through to a larger system framework (packages, apps, or services).
- Programming interfaces:
    when delivering data from one interface to another, components communicating with each other form a system relationship.
- Architecture style:
    defining the system's patterns and organized to be referred back to the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
    can be reused and reapplied to a variety of apps/solutions.

###### **Common Patterns**

    1. Monolithic
    2. Microservices
    3. Client-server
    4. Layered
    5. Event-driven

###### **Design principles and best practices**

    1. SOLID principles
    2. Separation of concerns
    3. Modularity and encapsulation
    4. Design patterns
    5. SDLC

## Why does Software Architecture matter?

Within the world of enterprise, apps are built on the foundation provided by software architecture. <br>
Businesses require a stable and well-defined base to ensure the successful development and operation of complex, large-scale systems. <br>
Given that, we can say clear architectural guidelines serve as a roadmap that lead to smoother implementation, greater efficiency, and long-term maintainability. <br>
A well-defined architecture with accurate diagrams, detailed design documentation, and a cohesive technology stack has directl impact to an application's functionality, scalability, security, maintainability, and good cost-efficiency. <br>
This also helps ensure compatibility with target platforms, addressing the maturity and adoption of technology while simplifying ongoing support and evolution of the system. <br>
