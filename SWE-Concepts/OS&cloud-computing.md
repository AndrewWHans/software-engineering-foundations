# Operating Systems (OS)

**What exactly are operating systems?**
<br>
Operating systems are a system software that manages all the resources of the computing device. They act as an **interface** between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware and manage overall resources/operations of the computer. <br>
An operating system would control and monitor the execution of other programs including application programs and other system software of the computer. <br>
Allows the user to communicate to the computer without needing to know the computer's language. Simply put: <br>

## Common Operating Systems and functions
Each OS has their own *GUI*, which is a way to allow the user to click on icons or buttons or menus on a displayed screen that has a combination of both text and graphics. <br>
Some common OS models include: Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux

As a **function**, the operating system has many operations such as:
- Resources: managing & allocating memory, CPU time, and other hardware resources within programs and processes that run on the computer <br>
- Processing: starting/stopping and managing processes/programs.<br>
- Memory: OS manages the computer's primary memory and provides mechanisms for optimizing memory use. <br>
- Security: implements security policies and mechanisms like access control or encryption <br>

And many more! There are also **types** operating systems too, including *batch, time-sharing, distributed, network, real-time*. To check out more, please refer to this [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-operating-systems/). <br>
