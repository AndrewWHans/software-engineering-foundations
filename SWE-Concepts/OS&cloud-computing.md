# Operating Systems (OS)

**What exactly are operating systems?**
<br>
Operating systems are system software that manages all the resources of the computing device. They act as an *intermediary* between the user and the computer's hardware. <br>
Due to an OS being large and complex, it must be created piece-by-piece with defined inputs and outputs (IO) and functons that control and monitor the execution of other programs. This would include application programs and other system software of the computer. <br>
The OS allows the user to communicate to the computer without needing to know the computer's language. From a computer point-of-view, this makes the operating system a resource allocator.<br> Simply put:

## Common Operating Systems and functions
Each OS has their own *GUI*, which is a way to allow the user to click on icons or buttons or menus on a displayed screen that has a combination of both text and graphics. <br>
Some common OS models include: Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux

As a **function**, the operating system has many operations such as:
- Resources: managing & allocating memory, CPU time, and other hardware resources within programs and processes that run on the computer.
- Processing: addressing the starting/stopping and managing processes/programs. The system ensures each process uses the CPU, synchronizes, and has access to resources in case.
- Memory: OS handles the computer's primary memory and provides mechanisms for optimizing memory use, ensuring accurate allocation and deallocations are proper to run programs smoothly.
- File Systems: manage how files get stored to storage devices, ensuring smooth access through directories and permissions. This includes attributes, types, operations, and access methods.
- Security: implements security policies and mechanisms like access control or encryption <br>
And many more! There are also **types** operating systems too, including *batch, time-sharing, distributed, network, real-time*. <br>

## Concepts

**Moore's Law**: the prediction that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit will double every 18 months.
The **kernel** is the core of the operating system, responsible for managing system resources and interacting directly with the hardware.
