**What exactly are operating systems?**
<br>
Operating systems are a system software that manages all the resources of the computing device. <br>
They act as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware and manage overall resources/operations of the computer. <br>
Controls and monitors execution of other programs including application programs and other system software of the computer <br>

As a function, the operating system has many operations such as:
- Resources: managing & allocating memory, CPU time, and other hardware resources within programs and processes that run on the computer <br>
- Processing: starting/stopping and managing processes/programs.<br>
- Memory: OS manages the computer's primary memory and provides mechanisms for optimizing memory use.<br>
- Security: implements security policies and mechanisms like access control or encryption<br>

And many more! There are also **types** operating systems too, including:
