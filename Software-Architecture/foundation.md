# Software Architecture

Architecture serves as a blueprint defining a system's crucial elements: structure, behavior, and interactions.
A view of architecture is a 'shared understanding that expert developers have of the system design.' <br>
The wish to get decisions **right** early on. <br>

## Building blocks/key components include:

- Software components:
    feature the data that can be plugged through to a larger system framework (packages, apps, or services).
- Programming interfaces:
    when delivering data from one interface to another, components communicating with each other form a system relationship.
- Architecture style:
    defining the system's patterns and organized to be referred back to the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
    can be reused and reapplied to a variety of apps/solutions.

    5. Event-driven

###### **Design principles and best practices**

    1. SOLID principles
    2. Separation of concerns
    3. Modularity and encapsulation
    4. Design patterns
