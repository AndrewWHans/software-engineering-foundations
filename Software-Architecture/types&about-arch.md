# Software Architecture
A view of architecture is a 'shared understanding that expert developers have of the system design.' 

The wish to get decisions **right** early on.

**Building blocks/key components include:** 
- software components:
    feature the data that can be plugged through to a larger system framework (packages, apps, or services).
- programming interfaces:
    when delivering data from one interface to another, components communicating with each other form a system relationship.
- architecture style:
    defining the system's patterns and organized to be referred back to the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
    can be reused and reapplied to a variety of apps/solutions.<br>
**common patterns**
    1. Monolithic
    2. Microservices
    3. Client-server
    4. Layered
    5. Event-driven

**Design principles and best practices**
    1. SOLID principles
    2. Separation of concerns
    3. Modularity and encapsulation
    4. Design patterns
