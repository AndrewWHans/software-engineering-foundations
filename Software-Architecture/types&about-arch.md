# Software Architecture
A view of architecture is a 'shared understanding that expert developers have of the system design.' 

The wish to get decisions **right** early on.

**building blocks include:** 
- software components:
    feature the data that can be plugged through to a larger system framework (packages, apps, or services).
- programming interfaces:
    when delivering data from one interface to another, components communicating with each other form a system relationship.
- architecture style:
    defining the system's patterns and organized to be referred back to the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
    can be reused and reapplied to a variety of apps/solutions.
